# Real-Time Color Detection Game using OpenCV

This project is a simple real-time game implemented in Python using OpenCV. The game uses your webcam to display a live feed, where colored objects fall from the top of the screen and the player controls a paddle to catch or interact with them. It’s a fun way to explore computer vision, color detection, and real-time interaction.

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

- **Red Objects:** Avoid them to increase your score.
- **Blue Objects:** Activate special power-ups (e.g., temporary shield).
- **Levels:** As time passes, the game gets faster and more challenging.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Make sure your webcam is connected.
2. Run : python game_filter.py
